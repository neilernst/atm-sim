This is an ATM simulator in Java. It is pretty primitive but useful for demo projects.

The original source seems to be from https://kenai.com/projects/atm-simulator-java (not the more popular one found [here](http://www.math-cs.gordon.edu/courses/cs320/ATM_Example/Code.html)
. 

Since the source is GPLv2, I've made this GPLv2 as well. I cleaned the code up, added simple package structure and resource handling, and left it as is. I may make some changes in order to simulate evolution.
